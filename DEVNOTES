Developer Notes
===============

All new options need to be added in five places:
- TextToHTML.pm init_our_args(), to initialize the default
- TextToHTML.pm args() in the parse-the-array-ref part, unless
  it is a simple option-with-a-value.  If it is a boolean option,
  it also needs to be added in its "no" form.
- TextToHTML.pm OPTIONS documentation
- texthyper.PL Getopt call, including its type and possible shortnames
- texthyper.PL OPTIONS documentation

If you want to change the location or name of the system link dictionary,
it needs to be changed in four places:
- Makefile.PL
- TextToHTML.pm init_our_args()
- TextToHTML.pm OPTIONS documentation
- texthyper.PL OPTIONS documentation
