HTML/TextToHTML version 0.01
============================

HTML::TextToHTML converts plain text files into HTML.  It is
based on Seth Golub's txt2html script (see http://www.aigeek.com/txt2html)

It supports headings, lists, simple character markup, and
hyperlinking, and is highly customizable. It recognizes some of the
apparent structure of the source document (mostly whitespace and
typographic layout), and attempts to mark that structure explicitly
using HTML. The purpose for this tool is to provide an easier way of
converting existing text documents to HTML format.
