Revision history for Perl module HTML::TextToHTML.
==================================================

0.06  Mon 2nd September 2002
	- fine-tuned some of the links in the default links dictionary
	- some internal rewriting

0.05  Wed 5th June 2002
	- fixed minor bugs

0.04  Sun 2nd June 2002
	- fixed bug with detection of paragraphs by indentation
	- added --indent_par_break and --preserve_indent options
	- fixed error in documentation
	- fixed bug with nonexistant link dictionaries

0.03  Sun 26th May 2002
	- documented the format of the Link Dictionary
	- added the do_help method, and changed the behaviour of --help
and --manpage
	- added the --make_anchors option, which enables one to disable
the making of anchors, so that if one prefers another method of
anchor-making (such as that in HTML::GenToc) then one can use that
instead.
	- altered the #bold# pattern in the link dictionary to only need one
hash.  This should still hopefully allow things like #1 without turning it
bold, and being able to use ### as a separator.
	- gratuitous self-promotion: added HTML::GenToc to the
sample links dictionary
	- removed the need for getline(), but rather pass the lines in to
the methods, in order to parse by-paragraph and then by-line (mucho rewrite)
which enabled me to:
	  * implement the table-parsing from Gareth Rees's HTML::FromText
module -- added the --make_tables option
	  * now the links dictionary does multiline matches (useful for
things like italics which break over lines)
	  * enable converting passed-in strings rather than just files

0.02  Wed 15th May 2002
	- fixed bug with link dictionary parsing
	- improved the tests
	- updated link dictionary to fix a few bugs (eg underlines)
and add a few things (like using double # for ##bold## text).

0.01  Sun 12th May 2002
	- conversion of txt2html to a module
	- made all global settings options (eg the location of the system
link dictionary)
	- added "outfile" option
	- added use_mosaic_header option
	- changed the dynamic code generation completely.
	- removed the evil $* variable
