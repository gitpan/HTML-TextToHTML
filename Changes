Revision history for Perl module HTML::TextToHTML.
==================================================

1.10  Wed 18th December 2002
	- removed all dependency on AppConfig
	  * all of the existing options now must use their full names.
	  * However, one now has the choice between passing options
as a hash, or the old way, as a reference to an array.
	- removed the do_help method; if you want the documentation
of the module, use perldoc HTML::TextToHTML
	- moved the texthyper script into this distribution
	  * It now uses Getopt::Long and Getopt::ArgvFile.
	  * The format of .texthyperrc has changed to conform with
Getopt::ArgvFile rather than AppConfig.
	  * Changed the version number so that it was bigger than
either the script or the module so that both could have the same
version number (that's why the big jump).
	- the included system link dictionary (TextToHTML.dict)
is now installed in /usr/share/txt2html as part of the install process.

0.09  Wed 20th November 2002
	- improved the XHTML mode, so that open paragraphs get closed
sooner. This fixed a bug related to paragraphs inside lists.

0.08  Wed 20th November 2002
	- CPAN testers complained about a lack of explicitly stating
all the dependencies of AppConfig, which either means that AppConfig
has changed desperately, or their testing methods have changed, since
I didn't think it was possible to get the AppConfig module without getting
all its dependent modules, but, oh well.

0.07  Sun 17th November 2002
	- fixed a bug in process_para to ensure that if one is using it
standalone, any open lists will be closed
	- added --lower_case_tags option to force the tags to be output
in lower-case
	- first pass at XHTML conformance; added --xhtml option.
It isn't that pretty-looking, but the sample does pass the scrutiny of "tidy".
When turned on it:
	  * forces lower-case on
	  * makes empty tags have the empty marker (eg <hr/>)
	  * closes all open P and LI tags where they should be closed
	  * table cell alignments are done as style attributes

0.06  Mon 2nd September 2002
	- fine-tuned some of the links in the default links dictionary
	- some internal rewriting

0.05  Wed 5th June 2002
	- fixed minor bugs

0.04  Sun 2nd June 2002
	- fixed bug with detection of paragraphs by indentation
	- added --indent_par_break and --preserve_indent options
	- fixed error in documentation
	- fixed bug with nonexistant link dictionaries

0.03  Sun 26th May 2002
	- documented the format of the Link Dictionary
	- added the do_help method, and changed the behaviour of --help
and --manpage
	- added the --make_anchors option, which enables one to disable
the making of anchors, so that if one prefers another method of
anchor-making (such as that in HTML::GenToc) then one can use that
instead.
	- altered the #bold# pattern in the link dictionary to only need one
hash.  This should still hopefully allow things like #1 without turning it
bold, and being able to use ### as a separator.
	- gratuitous self-promotion: added HTML::GenToc to the
sample links dictionary
	- removed the need for getline(), but rather pass the lines in to
the methods, in order to parse by-paragraph and then by-line (mucho rewrite)
which enabled me to:
	  * implement the table-parsing from Gareth Rees's HTML::FromText
module -- added the --make_tables option
	  * now the links dictionary does multiline matches (useful for
things like italics which break over lines)
	  * enable converting passed-in strings rather than just files

0.02  Wed 15th May 2002
	- fixed bug with link dictionary parsing
	- improved the tests
	- updated link dictionary to fix a few bugs (eg underlines)
and add a few things (like using double # for ##bold## text).

0.01  Sun 12th May 2002
	- conversion of Seth Golub's txt2html to a module
	- made all global settings options (eg the location of the system
link dictionary)
	- added "outfile" option
	- added use_mosaic_header option
	- changed the dynamic code generation completely.
	- removed the evil $* variable
