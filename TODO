TODO list for HTML::TextToHTML
==============================

- try to remove the need for getline(), but rather pass the lines in to
  the methods, in order to:
  - parse by-paragraph and then by-line (mucho rewrite)
    in order to:
    - implement the table-parsing from Gareth Rees's HTML::FromText module
    - implement broader italics/underline/bold matching so that one could
      for example, have an entire paragraph in italics, and it doesn't
      matter if the asterisks are on different lines
    - enable converting passed-in strings rather than just files
- alter the "section" anchors so that they depend on the content of the header
  (like the way it's done in HTML::GenToc)  This is useful if one happens
  to have built a HTML file from more than one text file.
- XHTML support
- recognise and reproduce different Ordered List styles.
- custom tags
